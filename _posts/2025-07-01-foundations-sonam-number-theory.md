## Abstract

We present a reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis within a novel mathematical framework called **Sonam’s Number Theory**, grounded in **fractal harmonics** and **recursive geometries**. In contrast to the linear notion of infinity embedded in traditional number theory, we introduce the **Inter Concept Space (ICS)** — a self-similar meta-mathematical field where zeroes of the Riemann zeta function appear as **fractal harmonic nodes**. This paper aims to establish foundational axioms for a new number...

## 1. Introduction

The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) deals with the distribution of prime numbers, captured by the nontrivial zeroes of the zeta function on the critical line $\,\Re(s) = 1/2$. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH), independent of ZFC, questions the nature of infinities. This paper proposes a speculative but structured reformulation of RH within a new domain — **Sonam’s Number Theory (SNT)** embedded in **ICS**.

---

## 2. Background

- RH posits all nontrivial $\,\zeta(s)$ zeroes have real part $1/2$
- CH claims no cardinality between $\aleph_0$ and $\mathfrak{c}$
- Gödel and Cohen showed CH is independent of ZFC
- This opens the door to rethinking "infinity"

## 3. Foundations of Sonam’s Number Theory

**Axiom 1: Recursive Unity**  
Every number is part of a self-similar fractal layer.

**Axiom 2: Multiple Zeroes**  
Zero is not unique, but manifests in recursive harmonic phases.

**Axiom 3: Fractal Field**  
Numbers exist not on a line but in layered fractal spaces with harmonic density.

**Axiom 4: Contextual Infinity**  
Infinity exists in layers of expansion, not as a scalar blow-up.

## 4. Fractal Harmonic Layers and Recursive Zeroes

In this view, $\,\zeta(s)$ projects harmonic structures from ICS. The zeroes are not isolated roots, but fixed points in **harmonic propagation** — intersections of self-similar fields.

---

## 5. Reformulating the Continuum

Traditional continuum = dense linear infinity.  
New view: $\mathfrak{c}$ = composite of recursive zeroes → uncountably many self-similar micro-realities between any two classical reals.  
CH becomes **structurally meaningless**.

---

## 6. Inter Concept Space (ICS)

ICS = meta-mathematical geometry, akin to **amplituhedrons** or **spin foams** in quantum geometry.  
It is not coordinate-based, but resonance-based.  
Numbers = nodes in a recursive holographic net.

---

## 7. Conclusion

This fractal reinterpretation of RH offers a **metaphysical yet mathematically suggestive** framework.  
Future work will formalize ICS differential operators and harmonic transforms.
